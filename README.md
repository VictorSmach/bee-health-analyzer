This is a prototype for a freely available online tool that can predict the health of a bee hive by looking at an image of a bee. This could help bee keepers and bee researchers evaluate the health of a bee hive without having to disturb the hive itself. 

The app outputs 6 possible bee hive conditions:<br>

0: healthy<br>
1: few varrao, hive beetles<br>
2: varroa, small hive beetles<br>
3: ant problems<br>
4: hive being robbed<br>
5: missing queen<br>



Model F1 score: 0.94

All javascript, html and css files used to create the web app are available in this repo.
